# Learning Reflections README

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

During this project I faced the task of designing a webpage based off an instagram profile in which I had to make use of Flexbox, Grid, Focus and Hover and styling css elememts in order to achieve a webpage that resembles that of a Insagram profile, additionally the website had to be repsonsive and adapt to the different screen sizes such as mobile screens.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **Hover and Focus**: I feel confident in my ability to manipulate the hover and focus tecniques in order to create interactive elements.
- **Responsive Design**: I was able to make good use of a media query to create a responsive design that adjusts according to the users screen of choice (size) Eg. Desktop and Mobile 
- **Styling Elements**: I feel I have become quite efficeint at styling elements in css in order to get the desired size, colour, margin and padding by successfully using selectors and making use of specifity.  

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: Having to create a page that responds the size of the screen was not a problem, however adjusting the sizes of the elements to make the page look neat and tidy took some time as there was a lot of trial and error that occured.
- **Manupilating Flexbox**: Manipulating Flexbox and the elements inside the container seemed to be quite tricky and so more practice is needed in order to build confidence in that regard.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Efficiency in Flexbox**: I would like to become more efficeint in using Flexbox when creating layouts in order to create more complex layouts for the future and also cut down on time spent problem solving issues that required simple solutions.
- **Element sizing using relative units**: I would like to put more practice using relative sizing units such as rem and em in order to have a better understanding of how they work and be able to use that understanding wehn reading other peoples code.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was quite useful in the sense that it allowed for practicing css layouts, styling and responisve design in a more real world setting. It also unvieled certain aspects of my knowledge and skill that I need to improve going forward.
